 MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) data handling in the `led_display.py` script involves several key functions:

1. **Reading MIDI Data**: The script reads MIDI data from a file or a live input source. This data includes information about note events, such as note-on and note-off messages, which indicate when a note is pressed or released.

2. **Processing MIDI Data**: The script processes the MIDI data to extract relevant information, such as the note number, velocity (how hard the note is pressed), and timing. This information is crucial for accurately displaying the notes on the LED matrix and controlling the piano key LEDs.

3. **Mapping Notes to LEDs**: The script maps the MIDI note numbers to specific LEDs on the 8x32 LED matrix. This involves converting the note numbers to corresponding LED positions, ensuring that the correct LEDs light up when a note is played.

4. **Timing and Synchronization**: The script ensures that the LED display is synchronized with the timing of the MIDI data. This involves handling the timing information from the MIDI messages to update the LED display in real-time, matching the tempo and rhythm of the music.

5. **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling mechanisms to manage any issues that arise during MIDI data reading and processing. This ensures that the LED display continues to function smoothly even if there are minor errors in the MIDI data.

These components work together to create a dynamic visual representation of the MIDI data on the LED matrix, enhancing the overall experience of playing and viewing the SmartPiano.
